# Knightâ€™s Tour
The Knight's Tour, a chess puzzle with origins dating back to the ninth century, involves a knight commencing its journey from any square on the board and then maneuvering through the remaining 63 squares, all without revisiting any previously occupied square.

## About

This project presents an engaging exploration of the Knight's Tour problem across a range of chessboard sizes, including 5x5, 6x6, 7x7, 8x8 and 9x9. It serves as an implementation and visualization of the Knight's Tour problem, featuring a solving algorithm constructed through recursion and the application of Warnsdorff's heuristic rule.
